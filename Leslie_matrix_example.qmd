# Matrix Example

Model population changes using the same example we did in lecture.

```{r}
# Create a vector and wrap with a matrix

insect_leslie <- matrix(
  c(0, 0, 600, 0.2, 0, 0, 0, 0.08, 0),
  nrow = 3,
  ncol = 3,
  byrow = TRUE
)

insect_leslie
```

```{r}
# Initial Condition
insect_y0 <- c(12000, 700, 500)

class(insect_y0)
```

```{r}
insect_y1 <- insect_leslie %*% insect_y0

insect_y1
```

Estimate populations at each life stage at year 2 and year 3

```{r}
insect_y2 <- insect_leslie %*% insect_y1

insect_y2

insect_y3 <- insect_leslie %*% insect_y2

insect_y3
```
